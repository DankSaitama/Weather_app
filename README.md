## Introduction

The Weather App is a Django-based web application designed to provide weather information. This documentation outlines the setup, configuration, and usage of the app in its development phase.

**Note:** This app is not yet hosted, and it is currently under development.

## Installation

To set up the Weather App for local development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source test/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize the database:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Configuration

In the development phase, you may need to configure the app. Here are some common configuration steps:

- **Settings**: Modify the `settings.py` file to configure settings such as database connections, API keys, and other environment-specific variables.

- **API Keys**: Your app relies on external weather data sources, and you have added the necessary API key to your settings.py file.

- **Debug Mode**: Set the `DEBUG` flag to `True` in `settings.py` for development. Remember to set it to `False` in production.

## Usage

Describe how to use your Weather App in its development phase. Include information on how to:

- Access the app in a web browser.
- Navigate the user interface.
- Search for weather information.
- Any other relevant functionality.


## Dependencies

List the major dependencies used in your project, along with their versions. This helps other developers understand the technology stack.

- Django: `4.2.5`
- Other libraries and packages: `pip install requests`
